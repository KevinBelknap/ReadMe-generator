## Description

The README Generator is a simple command-line tool that helps developers generate a professional README for their new project. By using the user's input, it creates a README.md file with essential sections like Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions.

## Table of Contents

* [Installation](#installation)
* [Usage](#usage)
* [License](#license)
* [Contributing Guidelines](#contributing-guidelines)
* [Questions](#questions)
* [Contact Information](#contact-information)


## Installation

To use the README Generator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies by running npm install / npm i. 

## Usage

To create a project README using the README Generator, execute the command `node index.js` in your project's folder. You'll receive prompts to enter details like project title, description, installation instructions, usage info, license, contributing guidelines, and more. After providing all the required information, the README.md file will be generated with the relevant sections and content. I provided a video below as a example.
